# HEMO TECH - Blood Group Detection System Using Image Procssing and deep learning.

## ABSTRACT

Blood group identification is an essential part of medical diagnostics and transfusion treatment procedures. Our novel approach to blood type detection is presented in this work using deep learning and image processing techniques. Orientated FAST, rotated BRIEF (ORB), and scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) algorithms are used in our method for feature extraction, while convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used for blood group photo classification. The image processing pipeline optimizes contrast and minimizes noise in blood group photos using SIFT and ORB before extracting discriminative features. Then, utilizing these traits, a CNN model is trained to precisely categorize blood types. As the CNN model is designed to recognize and comprehend the unique patterns associated with different blood types, it might offer dependable and strong prediction. Using extensive trials on a variety of blood group imaging datasets, we evaluate our method. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for identifying blood types, with outstanding classification accuracy and resistance to variations in image quality. Our recommended approach could make blood group identification in medical settings easier and allow for rapid, automated blood sample analysis. Additionally, merging deep learning with feature extraction techniques enhances the effectiveness and precision of blood type prediction, hence improving transfusion management and patient care.

## METHODOLOGY

A notable development in the realm of medical diagnostics is the suggested approach for blood group identification. The technology uses computer vision and machine learning to automate the blood group diagnosis procedure by combining image processing and deep learning techniques. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used to extract complicated features from blood samples. This makes it possible for the system to examine and recognize minute patterns and traits that could be indicative of particular blood types. Moreover, the system's capacity to identify and match important points and descriptors within the images is improved by the addition of Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), Oriented FAST, and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) algorithms, which add to the blood group classification process' accuracy and resilience. Even though this multi-stage process seems very promising, it's vital to think about potential drawbacks, such the requirement for huge and varied training datasets to guarantee the accuracy of the system across variances in blood samples. Significant computational resources may also be needed due to the computational complexity of deep learning methods. It will be crucial to assess the system's performance across a range of circumstances, such as changes in illumination and picture quality, to guarantee its dependability in practical applications.
