# HEMO TECH - Blood Group Detection System Using Image Procssing and deep learning.

## ABSTRACT

Blood group identification is an essential part of medical diagnostics and transfusion treatment procedures. Our novel approach to blood type detection is presented in this work using deep learning and image processing techniques. Orientated FAST, rotated BRIEF (ORB), and scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) algorithms are used in our method for feature extraction, while convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used for blood group photo classification. The image processing pipeline optimizes contrast and minimizes noise in blood group photos using SIFT and ORB before extracting discriminative features. Then, utilizing these traits, a CNN model is trained to precisely categorize blood types. As the CNN model is designed to recognize and comprehend the unique patterns associated with different blood types, it might offer dependable and strong prediction. Using extensive trials on a variety of blood group imaging datasets, we evaluate our method. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for identifying blood types, with outstanding classification accuracy and resistance to variations in image quality. Our recommended approach could make blood group identification in medical settings easier and allow for rapid, automated blood sample analysis. Additionally, merging deep learning with feature extraction techniques enhances the effectiveness and precision of blood type prediction, hence improving transfusion management and patient care.

## EXISTING SOLUTION
Traditional blood group detection systems

1. Manual and Time-Consuming Process
   - The traditional approach to blood group identification is a manual, labor-intensive process.
   - This can lead to delays in diagnosis and potentially impact patient care.

2. Reliance on Human Expertise
   - The traditional method relies heavily on the expertise and accuracy of trained personnel.
   - This can introduce the potential for human error and inconsistencies in the blood group identification.

3. Limited Scalability
   - The traditional manual process may not be able to keep up with the increasing demand for efficient and high-throughput blood group detection.
   - Scaling the traditional system to handle a larger volume of samples could be challenging.

4. Limited Adaptability
   - The traditional system may struggle to adapt to variations in blood sample characteristics, changes in lighting conditions, or evolving diagnostic requirements.
   - This can limit the system's ability to maintain consistent and reliable performance in diverse real-world scenarios.
